Annalee Maples is a young girl, who just had her seventh birthday a month ago, in the month of June. It is now July, and she was having a fun time being 7 years old. Of course she wasn't as old as Jack, who was almost 12, nor was she as young as Judy, sho was 4 and not yet old enough to run out back and play next to the stream. Annalee was old enough, and responsible enough to do just that though, and that is what she is doing this evening. There were little grey fish in the stream, who would race around and play with each other during the day, but now were starting to hide aound their favorite rocks to get ready to go to bed. Annalee enjoys watching them during the day, when the sun is high and the water and scales on the fish are all a-sparkle with the sunshine's warm rays. 

This evening, she is digging a hole in the soft mud next to the stream to fill with water and make a little pool for the small wooden figures to play in thatDad had made for her when she was 6. It was getting close to suppertime, and Mama would probably soon call for her to wash up and help set the table. In fact, it was just that time, because Mama put her face next to the screened window above the kitchen sink, and called across the yard, "Annalee, come wash up and get the table ready for supper, dear." "Yes Mama," came the reply next to the stream. Filling the hole with water would have to wait. At least she had gotten the hole mostly dug out with the little spade Mama had shown her in the shed. After rinsing her hands in the stream, Annalee collected her wooden figures in a little make-do pouch made with her shirt and ran up the yard to the little wash basin with the garden hose next to it. The woosh of the cold water on her feet sent shivers up her spine; it was so cold! She dried off with the towel she had set out this morning, and opened the screen door.
