I find it hard to remember your face,
But I am confronted by it every week
So I never forget.

###

Tell me how we used to laugh
Before the crash took from me
The memory of you.

###

The hard ground is better than a soft bed
When the soft bed is empty.

###

Please sit with me a while
Before the crowded wave hits
And we have no where to exist.

###

A large part of me wants to run.
A smaller part says, "Wait."
My loving God keeps me
From terrible mistakes.

###

A season
Unpleasant outside and inside my skin.
What reason?
